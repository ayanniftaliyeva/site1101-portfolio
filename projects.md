# Projects & Experiences

My work reflects my commitment to **systems thinking, technical excellence, and human-centered design**. Below are key projects that demonstrate my capabilities across event leadership, technical programming, and strategic collaboration.

## Logic Gates Simulation
### A Deep Dive into Boolean Algebra & Binary Logic

I led the development of an interactive simulation that demystifies foundational Boolean logic concepts. This project showcases my ability to bridge technical complexity with intuitive user interface design.

**What I Did:**
- Architected the core Boolean logic engine (AND, OR, NOT gates)
- Designed a clean, accessible UI that helps students experiment and learn
- Implemented input validation and error handling
- Created interactive visualizations for logic gate behavior

**Technical Skills:** Logic design, UI/UX, user testing, validation systems

## Hour of Code (HOC) Event
### Strengthening Algorithmic Thinking & Digital Literacy

I coordinated and facilitated a successful Hour of Code event, bringing computer science education to peers and the broader community.

**What I Did:**
- Organized event logistics and volunteer coordination
- Designed curriculum for mixed-skill-level participants
- Facilitated hands-on coding sessions and provided mentorship
- Captured the energy and impact of the event through photography and videography

**Impact:** Engaged 50+ participants in algorithmic thinking, increased digital literacy awareness

## Volunteering & International Conferences
### Applying Systems Thinking to Event Logistics & High-Pressure Communication

Through diverse volunteer roles at international conferences and large-scale events, I've demonstrated my ability to manage complex logistics, lead teams, and maintain composure in high-pressure environments.

**What I Did:**
- Managed event timelines, vendor coordination, and stakeholder communication
- Led team coordination during peak event hours
- Applied systems thinking to solve real-time logistical challenges
- Built meaningful connections with international participants and colleagues

**Key Takeaway:** Systems thinking isn't just theory—it's a practical skill that makes a tangible difference in how organizations operate at scale.
