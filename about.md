# About Me

I am a Freshman in the **School of IT and Engineering (SITE)** at ADA University. As a natural perfectionist, I aim for excellence through disciplined study and a thoughtful approach to Information Systems.

### Philosophy & Drive
* **Perfectionist Nature**: I am demanding of my work, ensuring every project is honest and thorough.
* **Social Architecture**: I love people and communication; I am a highly social individual who thrives in collaborative environments.
* **Multitasking**: I feel most alive when I am productive, balancing coding with dancing, planning, and creating vision boards.

### Goals
I dream big with a "delusional" belief in my own potential—because I know that with enough action, dreams become reality.
